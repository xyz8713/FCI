MAIN: 

Classes 4_0  4_3 4_4 and 4_6
==================== 

In  each  case,  there  is   a  setup  function  precClass4_x  and  an
 application ratPrec4_x Only  one driver testPrec4.m is  needed to run
 both classes.  In addition each class has many different options that
 can be set in the parameters ITopts.outer [outer method or method for
 solving the (I-P)A\inv part] and ITopts.inner [ineer method or method
 for solving the P A\inv part]... for explanations regarding these see 
 the comments in the methods referenced..

 This the first preconditioner [cauchy integra with ILUs]

 precClass4_0      = class for preconditioner 4_0... 
                     This is what was used in the paper
		     adapted from earlier code by Yuanzhe 
		     some changes -- in particular the coeff 1/2
                     is now lumped into the the `om' values retured by
		     contQuad

 ratPrec4_0 preconditioning operation associated with Class4 precon
            this calls fgmrez_dr2 which in turn calls the preconditioner
	    ratPrecD3_c

 ratPrecD3_c.m	= preconditioner for the residual problem (A P x = b) 
           
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 This is the second preconditioner [cauchy integrals with fom and gmres without
             ILU and with ILU for some methods]
                               

 precClass4_3      = class for preconditioner 4_3... 
                     This is what was used in the paper
		     adapted from earlier code by Yuanzhe 
		     some changes -- in particular the coeff 1/2
                     is now lumped into the the `om' values retured by
		     contQuad

 ratPrec4_3 preconditioning operation associated with Class4 precon
            this calls fgmrez_dr2 which in turn calls the preconditioner
	    ratPrecD3_d

 ratPrecD3_d.m	= preconditioner for the residual problem (A P x = b) 
  
 !! You can also test just the pure ILU precondiotioner [no cauchy integral]
 by choosing ITopts.outer = 0;  For comparison purposes

  fgmrez.m       = outer preconditioned fgmres. 

  fgmrez_dr2.m   = (inner) complex flexible gmres with deflation.
